### Obtaining the ARC Traces


I obtained traces from here:

http://researcher.watson.ibm.com/researcher/view_person_subpage.php?id=4700

search for "traces"

If that page is down / moved, the authors of this paper should be able
to help you find the traces:

Overhead Replacement Cache," USENIX Conference on File and Storage
