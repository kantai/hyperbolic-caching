Licensing and Distribution of Applications
==========================================

I (Aaron Blankstein) do not want to sort out, or be responsible for,
the legal ramifications of distributing other people's software. As
such, this directory is EMPTY!

Of course, in the spirit of open research and reproducibility, I will
try retain access to these applications, but I won't distribute them here.
If you'd like the applications (and some documentation on how to get
them up and running), shoot me an e-mail, and I'll help you out.
